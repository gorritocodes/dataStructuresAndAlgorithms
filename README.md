# About this project

This project is made to practice algorithms and data structures in typeScript, and to follow along with the book "Easy Learning Data Structures Algorithms Javascript" by Yang Hu.

Also I made some changes to make the exercise more challenging and interesting. I reimplemented the example code in typeScript and added test to practices some TDD.

## How to use

Run the command `npm run dev` to start the server.
